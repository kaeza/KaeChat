KaeChat - An IRC client written in Python
----------------------------------------

KaeChat is a simple Internet Relay Chat client written from scratch in Python,
using Tkinter and Tix as GUI toolkit. It was done as a fun project to learn
more about networking, threading, and the IRC protocol.

It's still in "alpha" stage; don't expect many features at the moment.

See also the `TODO.txt' file for things that need to be done (suggestions for
improvements/features are welcome, of course).
