TO-DO List:
-----------

- Test this on a real network (testing at home by myself with Debian ircd).
- SSL support.
- Implement send queue to prevent possible "Excess Flood" QUITs.
- Is this really thread-safe?
- Better GUI: Menus, options dialog, connection dialog. (working on it)
- Tkinter keybindings suck. Redefine those.
- Support missing commands: DCC, ...
- Better plugin support.
- Py3K support? (s/\?/!/)
- Better reporting for errors sent by server.
- `grep 'TO''DO' -rn .`
- Code sucks. Maybe rewrite.
