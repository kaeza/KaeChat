2014-03-11 kaeza:
    - lib: Reformatting of code to fit into 80-column display.
    - lib: Change in API: All public attributes of classes are now implemented
           as "properties" (via `@property' decorator). Only a handful of
           attributes are now writable.
    - lib: Documented all public symbols that missed documentation.
    - lib: Removed ugly `from x import *' statements.
    - lib: Removed `irc.Client.privmsg_action()' method and added a generic
           `irc.Client.privmsg_ctcp()' method.

2014-03-10 kaeza:
    - gui: Changed all "modal" dialogs (Network list, Network editor, About
       dialog, Preferences dialog) to derive from `tkSimpleDialog.Dialog'.
    - gui: Implemented better "About" dialog (using a `Tix.NoteBook').

2014-03-09 kaeza:
    - gui: Finally implemented `/server' and `/quit' commands (`core' plugin).
    - gui: Client now reports when a requested nickname (via `/nick') is
       already in use.

2014-03-08 kaeza:
    - lib: Nicks are now stored as a `(realnick, mode)' tuple. This is because
       since nicks are stored in lowercase in the mapping, you cannot get
       the "real" nickname (i.e. had problems if somebody used uppercase
       chars in the nick).
    - gui: Implemented simple "About" dialog.

2014-03-07 kaeza:
    - gui: Connection errors are now reported in "(server)" channel.
    - gui: Added `on_kaechat_quit' callback to plugin interface.

2014-03-06 kaeza:
    - gui: Added simple demonstration plugin (`demo' plugin).
    - gui: Implemented "Add" and "Edit" in Network List dialog.
    - gui: Changed way `kaechatlib.load_networks()' stores configuration. Now
       if `username', `realname', or `nicks' options are not specified per
       network, they are stored as `None'. This prevents the "Edit Network"
       dialog from copying global options to per-network options.
    - gui: Dialog windows are now not resizable.
    - gui: Implemented Network -> Disconnect.

2014-03-05 kaeza:
    - lib: Implemented `irc.Client.away()'.
    - gui: Added support to register command aliases.
    - gui: Added support for AWAY and related commands and replies. Also added
       `/away' and `/back' commands. Also added `/afk' as an alias for
       `/away' (`core' plugin).
    - gui: Changed the way chat commands are registered. Now it's cleaner.
    - gui: Added `/sh' command, to run shell commands and optionally send the
       output to a channel/query. Also added `/!' as an alias for `/sh'
       (`shell' plugin).
    - gui: Client now replies CTCP PING queries.
    - gui: Added (probably hacky) `/ping' command (`core' plugin).
    - gui: Implemented `nick_complete_suffix', `notices_to_chan' and
       `highlights_to_chan' options. Also implemented CTCP reply
       configuration (unused currently; need to implement this in
       `ClientThread').
    - gui: Text boxes meant only for output are disabled to prevent user input.

    - gui: Implemented RPL_WHOISUSER handling.
    - gui: Implemented `/(un)ban', `/(de)op', and `/(de)voice' commands
       (`chanop' plugin). Also moved `/kick' command to `chanop'.
    - gui: Added basic support for CTCP queries (currently only VERSION and
       TIME). Added `/ctcp' command for sending queries, and `/nctcp'
       for replying (`ctcp' plugin).

    - lib: Added some missing replies from RFCs 2810-2813.
    - lib/gui: Fixed bugs in QUIT handling.
    - lib: Fixed bugs in JOIN and PART handling (users not being updated).

       plugin.
    - gui: Added /ignore command (`ignore' plugin).
    - gui: Added /kick and /quote commands (`core' plugin).

       window now contains a notebook onto which network frames are added.

    - gui: Added colored nick support, and colored channel names on events.

    - gui: Added topic box at top of channels. Pressing return while box is
       focused sends TOPIC message.
