# Plugin API

Plugins are loaded from `~/.kaechat/plugins' and `<kaechatroot>/plugins'.
Only Python scripts in source form (*.py) are supported at the moment.

Plugins are loaded as if they were modules. Plugin initialization (if needed)
should be done in the main body of the module.

In order to receive events from the program, you need to define specially named
functions in the main body of the module. These are currently supported events:

Note: each of the functions is called through `kaechatlib.plugins.call_plugins'
in turn in a FIFO manner, and if one returns a value other than None that
function returns this value. Unless otherwise noted, the return value is
unused.

## on_networkframe_create(frame)

Called when a new NetworkFrame is created. Plugins can add widgets to it if
desired, or add a new listener for IRC commands with
`frame.client.add_listener()'. See `irc.Client' for details.

## on_channelframe_create(frame)

Called when a new ChannelFrame is created. Plugins can add widgets to it if
desired. Please note that `frame.channel' starts with '(', it's a "special"
channel (like "(server)"). Such channels don't have user lists. If you need
to know which network this channel is in, use `frame.master'; it's the parent
NetworkFrame.

# on_prefswindow_create(window)

Called when the "Preferences" window is created. Can be used by plugins to add
new configuration pages (as pages of `window.notebook'). See `Tix.NoteBook' for
details.

# on_prefswindow_commit(window)

Called when the "OK" button is pressed in the "Preferences" window. Should be
used by plugins to actually commit the configuration changes.
